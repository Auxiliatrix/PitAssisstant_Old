# PitAssisstant
PitAssistant is a program designed specifically for use by FRC teams in order to help keep track of items in their pits.
Currently, PitAssisstant goes under the name of HannahBot, named after the wonderful organizer Hannah, from team 604.
As of right now, PitAssisstant(HannahBot) is version 1.8, and supports description-based queries and several easter eggs, because programmers get bored.

The code is open-source, under the MIT License.
