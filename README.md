# PitAssisstant
PitAssistant is a program designed specifically for use by FRC teams in order to help keep track of items in their pits.
Currently, PitAssisstant goes under the name of HannahBot, named after the wonderful organizer Hannah, from team 604.
As of right now, PitAssisstant(HannahBot) is version 1.8, and supports description-based queries and several easter eggs, because programmers get bored.

The code is open-source, so that you can all look at it and pretend to look smart while saying "yeah, I totally could have done that."
Well, you didn't. Sang Gi Kim, the Programming Officer from Quixilver Team 604, made it, and Pranav Seetha of the same team is working on the GUI.
