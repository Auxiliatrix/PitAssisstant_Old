# PitAssisstant
PitAssistant is a program designed specifically for use by FRC teams in order to help keep track of items in their pits.
Currently, PitAssisstant goes under the name of HannahBot, named after the wonderful organizer Hannah, from team 604.
As of right now, PitAssisstant(HannahBot) is version 3.4, and supports description-based queries, tracks your borrowed item, has a cool langauage processor, and several easter eggs, because programmers get bored.

The code is open-source, so that you can all look at it and pretend to look smart while saying "yeah, I totally could have done that."
Well, you didn't. 604 Quixilver's Programmers did. But it was mostly Sang Gi. Have fun!

By the way, you can download the latest executable [here](tinyurl.com/PitAssistant3dot8).
